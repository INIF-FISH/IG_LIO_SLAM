# Nav2 Util

The `nav2_util` package contains utilities abstracted from individual packages which may find use in other uses. Examples include the particle filter implementation from AMCL, motion models, ROS2 node utilities, and more. 

## ROS1 Comparison

This package does not have a direct counter-part in Navigation. This was created to abstract out sections of the code-base from their implementations should the base algorithms/utilities find use elsewhere.
