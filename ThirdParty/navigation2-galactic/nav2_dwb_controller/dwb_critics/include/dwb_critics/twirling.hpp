 *
 * This class provides a cost based on how much a robot "twirls" on its way to the goal. With
 * differential-drive robots, there isn't a choice, but with holonomic or near-holonomic robots,
 * sometimes a robot spins more than you'd like on its way to a goal. This class provides a way
 * to assign a penalty purely to rotational velocities.
