 * @brief Templatized interface for a priority queue
 *
 * This is faster than the std::priority_queue implementation in certain cases because iterating does
 * not require resorting after every element is examined.
 * Based on https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/pull/525
 * The relative speed of this against the priority queue depends how many items with each
 * priority are inserted into the queue.
 *
 * One additional speed up depends on the patterns of priorities during each iteration of the queue.
 * If the same priorities are inserted into the queue on every iteration, then it is quicker to
 * set reset_bins = false, such that the priority bins are not reset and will not have to be recreated
 * on each iteration.
